We propose Spatio-Temporal Occlusion-Resilient Modeling for Procedure Step Recognition (STORM-PSR), a dual-stream framework for Procedure step recognition (PSR) that leverages both spatial and temporal features. PSR task aims to identify all correctly completed steps and their sequential order in videos of procedural tasks. The existing state-of-the-art models rely solely on detecting assembly object states in individual video frames.

STORM-PSR is evaluated on the MECCANO and IndustReal datasets, reducing the average delay between actual and predicted assembly step completions by 11.2\% and 26.1\%, respectively, compared to the [SOTA methods](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2024/papers/Schoonbeek_IndustReal_A_Dataset_for_Procedure_Step_Recognition_Handling_Execution_Errors_WACV_2024_paper.pdf).

## Object detection stream model
Please refer to the IndustReal assembly state detection [tutorial](https://github.com/TimSchoonbeek/IndustReal/tree/main/ASD) to train the assembly state detection stream.

## Temporal Stream model
### To train a temporal-stream model
```bash
cd STORM-PSR/temporal_stream/jobscript
sh train_test_eval_ft_pipeline.sh
```
### To test a temporal-stream model
```bash
cd STORM-PSR/temporal_stream/jobscript
sh test.sh
```

## To extract spatial embeddings
```bash
cd STORM-PSR/temporal_stream/pretrained_models
sh extract_embeddings.sh
```

## To evaluate a model
```bash
cd STORM-PSR/PSR_evaluation
# To evaluate the STORM-PSR model
sh evaluate_STORM_PSR.sh

 # To evaluate the assembly state detection stream
sh evaluate_ASDStream.sh

# To evaluate the Temporal Stream model
sh evaluate_TemporalStream.sh  
```



### To visualize spatial embedding using UMAP / t-SNE
Please refer to [STORM-PSR/temporal_stream/visualize_embedding/visualize_embedding.ipynb](./temporal_stream/visualize_embedding/visualize_embedding.ipynb) to visualize the spatial embedding using UMAP / t-SNE.
